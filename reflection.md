The biggest problems that I faced were trying to get Chat to do what I wanted.

I used this assignment to try and use chat in the way that this class has intended which was for most of the coding. In the end, I found that understanding what I needed to do froma  css and html standpoint allowed me to craft better prompts and edit thigns accordingly. I found that after a few attempts I was able to get chat to do what I wanted with the best precision form a longer prompt initally, and then honing in on the finer details after that. I tryed about 5 or si times and found that stonger language produces better results when using chat. In short, being nice was not the best solution. There are several different variables that change what chat does but temperature does seem to do the most. Using cold and shot, often strong language forces chat to do more of what you want. Ultimately This was the best I could get and plan on employing this strategy more throughout the calss.
